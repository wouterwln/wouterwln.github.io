## Project Overview

This research project aims to apply Active Inference principles to learn and optimize football tactics in real-world scenarios. By modeling football players as Active Inference agents, we can develop a framework that learns optimal positioning, movement patterns, and decision-making in dynamic game situations. The project combines cutting-edge AI research with practical sports applications.

## Research Goals

- Develop an Active Inference framework for multi-agent coordination in football
- Create realistic simulations of football scenarios using RxEnvironments.jl
- Bridge the gap between theoretical models and practical football tactics
- Validate learned strategies in real-world training scenarios

## Technical Approach

- Multi-agent Active Inference implementation using RxInfer.jl
- Real-time position and movement tracking data integration
- Hierarchical model structure for different time scales:
  - Strategic level (game plan)
  - Tactical level (situational decisions)
  - Operational level (individual movements)
- Integration with existing football analytics frameworks

## Applications

- Automated tactical analysis of game situations
- Real-time strategy suggestions during matches
- Training program optimization
- Player development through personalized feedback
- Team composition optimization

## Student Opportunities

We are currently recruiting Master's students interested in:

- Machine Learning
- Active Inference
- Multi-agent Systems
- Real-world AI Applications
- Football

Ideal candidates should have:

- Strong programming skills (Julia/Python)
- Interest in sports analytics
- Background in machine learning or AI
- Understanding of football tactics (playing experience is a plus)

## Current Status

This is an ongoing research project where we collaborate with football clubs to validate our approaches. We're particularly interested in:

- Developing new Active Inference models for team sports
- Creating practical tools for coaches and analysts
- Validating theoretical models with real-world data
- Bridging the gap between AI research and sports practice

Interested students can contact me for more information about thesis opportunities in this project.
