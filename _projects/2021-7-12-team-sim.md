## Project Overview

I created an environment that simulates a season for my futsal team in terms of player attendance. I modelled injuries using a geometrical distribution and incorporated how injury prone everybody is. I also made it GPU accelerated since it was very slow to run over CPU. Then I ran the simulation 10k times to get a sense of how many players we would have in every match over a season. We used this to decide if we'd ask new players to join our team.

## Technical Details

- GPU-accelerated simulation engine
- Geometric distribution for injury modeling
- Individual injury proneness factors
- 10,000 season simulations for statistical significance

## Future Development

The code is pretty much complete and serves its purpose well in its current form. While there's always room for cleanup and error-proofing, the project has successfully achieved its main goal of informing team size decisions.
