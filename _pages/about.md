I am a PhD student at [BIASlab](https://biaslab.github.io), primarily interested in the theory of learning. My PhD project concerns transferring Free Energy Principle-based design from an academic neuroscientific interest to a method of engineering real-time learning systems, in particular in the context of situated design of augmented hearing reality algorithms. Specifically, I focus on developing hierarchically organized Active Inference agents that can plan over different timespans. At [Lazy Dynamics](https://lazydynamics.com/), I try to bring these ideas to practice by developing biologically inspired AI agents.

As an amateur football and futsal player at [Totelos](https://www.totelos.nl/t2), I am especially intrigued by the application of Machine Learning and other data-driven techniques in sports.

## Current Interests and Projects:

- Bayesian Machine Learning and Active Inference, designing bio-inspired real-time learning intelligent agents using Free Energy Minimisation.
- Julia programming language and its ecosystem, especially the development of an Active Inference ecosystem in Julia (see [RxEnvironments.jl](https://github.com/biaslab/RxEnvironments.jl) and [RxInfer.jl](https://www.rxinfer.ml))
- Usage of gradient-based methods in the analysis and improvement of sport performance. Co-owner of [MoreMovement](https://moremovement.nl/), where I try to integrate state-of-the-art learning techniques in the world of sports.
